            <h3>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br>
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br>
                 It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br></h3>

            <p class="stik">Why do we use it?</p>
            <h3>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. <br>The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution<br> of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing <br>packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' <br>will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. <br>Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, <br>sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</h3>

            <p class="stik">Where does it come from?</p>
            <h3>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature <br>from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.Richard McClintock, a Latin professor <br> at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, <br>and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum <br>comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. <br>This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. <br>The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",<br> comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</h3>

            <h3>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, <br>by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. <br>If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.<br>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the <br>first true generator on the Internet. <br>It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures,<br> to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is<br> therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, <br>or non-characteristic words etc.</h3>
